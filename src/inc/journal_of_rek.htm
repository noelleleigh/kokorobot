<h2>2024-02-17 Network of Trust</h2>

<p>February 14th marks my 8th year living aboard {Pino}! The boat is doing well, although Dev & I both suffered a cold these past few days. We are two disgusting snot fountains.</p>

<p>Because it is becoming harder and harder to find good information on the internet by way of search engines, I overhauled my list of {bookmarks}, documenting my favorite websites and resources to try and combat AI garbage generators and websites that spin content. Building lists of trusted links written by experienced and well-meaning humans, and hosting them on your website, is a good way to create a network of trust.</p>

<p>I completed <a href="ruler_of_the_taiga.html">Ruler of the Taiga</a>. It is annoying how even if I just completed {Night Terror}, I already dislike a lot of the art. My hand and my eye keeps improving, it's a good thing but it makes it difficult to appreciate work now that I was proud of at the time of completion. The spell wears off so quickly. I am glad I am improving, but I hate being this inconsistent. I've always assumed that once I learned to draw that I could only get better at it, that regressing was not possible, but if there are too many long lulls between drawing sessions(months, years...) I realized that it is possible to lose it. The skill isn't lost entirely, but the work can appear stiff. Drawing will always make me happy, but I hope that my work eventually stabilizes. Note that this 'regression' is only true when drawing characters with realistic proportions (projects like {Hakum}, and {Circa}), errors are more apparent in designs like this than with a project with a cartoon style like {mindbird}.</p>

<p>I did a few {sprite} commissions, see <a href="../media/content/project/sprite/sprite_43_full.jpg">Alex P.</a>, <a href="../media/content/project/sprite/sprite_44_full.jpg">Benji and family(1)</a>, and <a href="../media/content/project/sprite/sprite_44_full.jpg">Benji(2)</a>.</p>

<p>I made some modifications to {rope mats}, so that intructions are clearer. I made a tiny mat out of red paracord for a friend this month for v-day, I missed making mats, I plan to make more this month.</p>
