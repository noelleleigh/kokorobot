<p><a href="wiktopher.html">Wiktopher</a> is now available on <a href="../media/content/stories/wiktopher/wiktopher_10.jpg">paperback</a>! It's possible to get it <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/rek-bell-and-devine-lu-linvega/wiktopher/paperback/product-m22wv96.html?page=1&pageSize=4" target="_blank">here</a>. I've already received my test copy and was very pleased with the <a href="../media/content/stories/wiktopher/wiktopher_11.jpg">result</a>!</p>

<p>I released 3 new pages (hellooo productivity!) for <a href="hakum.html">Hakum</a>, see page <a href="../media/content/stories/hakum/night/p8.jpg">8</a>, <a href="../media/content/stories/hakum/night/p9.jpg">9</a>, and <a href="../media/content/stories/hakum/night/p10.jpg">10</a> on <a href="night_terror.html">Night Terror</a>.</p>

<p>As a Christmas present to ourselves, me and Dev purchased a <a href="../media/content/sewing/sailrite_ours.jpg">Sailrite Ultrafeed LSZ sewing machine</a>! We tried one for the first time in 2016, having <a href="../media/content/sewing/sailrite.jpg">borrowed one</a> from a friend to repair our sail coverâ€”we've wanted one ever since. We had another machine aboard Pino but there's a lot of materials it can't handle, we're sick of breaking needles, damaging fabric and wasting thread. Right now I am working at <a href="https://100r.co/site/upholstery.html" target="_blank">reupholstering</a> Pino's interior, a good machine will help speed up that process. I'd also really like to learn to make clothes, because it would lovely to have clothes that fit properly for once.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I've updated my <a href="bookmarks.html">bookmarks</a>, I've also added a bunch of drawings to a number of pages on this website to make things more fun.</p>
