<p>I've added pages <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/stories/hakum/night/p4.jpg" target="_blank">4</a>,<a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/stories/hakum/night/p5.jpg" target="_blank">5</a>, and <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/stories/hakum/night/p6.jpg" target="_blank">6</a> for the <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/night_terror.html" target="_blank">Night Terror</a> comic sequence. This month I also designed a font based on my handwriting for this same project. It was my first time ever making a font, and I really enjoyed the process, so much that I made a short <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/making_a_font.html" target="_blank">write-up</a> about it.</p>

<p>Devine & I worked at translating <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/thousand_rooms.html" target="_blank">Thousand Rooms</a> into <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/solresol.html" target="_blank">Solresol</a>. Devine translated the text from English, but I put the text to a <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/stories/thousandrooms/solresol.jpg" target="_blank">staff as notes</a>.</p>

<p>I drew a <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/stories/wiktopher/lupeneka.jpg" target="_blank">small illustration</a> for <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/wiktopher.html" target="_blank">Wiktopher</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I spent time repairing a bunch of things! I replaced the <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/sewing.html" target="_blank">zipper on my winter jacket</a>(see latest entry), and finally replaced the keyboard on <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/obi.html" target="_blank">Obi</a>. It is so nice to have a functional keyboard again!</p>
