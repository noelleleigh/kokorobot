<p>A short post to make it clear where I stand as a person, and with my work.</p>

<p><b>This website has no tracking or analytics.</b></p>

<p><a href="https://notbyai.fyi" class="noglyph" target="_blank"><img src='../media/interface/fuck_ai.png' loading='lazy' style="float: left"></a> The art produced on this website is all done by a human. Creative AI-generated content is hollow, it is a grotesque parody of what it is to be human and I want nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>I am <b>committed</b> to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and white supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary. To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking.</p>

<p>I am <b>aggressively</b> opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, nationalism, ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power structures of all kinds.</p>
