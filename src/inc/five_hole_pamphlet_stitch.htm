<h2>Bookbinding 101: Five-Hole Pamphlet Stitch </h2>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1x flat, polished tool used to score a fold in the paper into a permanent position (whatever works)</li>
    <li>1x thick needle (sail needle will work)</li>
    <li>1x pair of scissors</li>
    <li>1x ruler</li>
    <li>1x sewing awl</li>
</ul>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 roll thread</li>
    <li>5 sheets (A4) paper for pages</li>
    <li>1 sheet decorative (A4) paper for cover</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Folding a sheet in half yields a folio. A signature is a compilation of two or more loose folios. The simplest method of binding a single signature codex, or a book bound on one edge, is with a pamphlet stitch. In this technique, the cover and signature are sewn at once. There are three basic variations of the pamphlet stitch: the three-hole (station), the four-hole and the five-hole. Today, I’ll share a tutorial for my favorite variation — the five-hole pamphlet stitch.</p>

<p>1. Using your bone folder, fold each of the five “pages” in half and nest them together.</p>

<p>2. Fold the “cover” in half.</p>

<p>3. Using your ruler and a pencil, mark five sewing stations. Station 3 is exactly in the center of the spine. Stations 2 and 4 are equidistant from the center. (I marked them 1.5″ from Station 1.) Stations 1 and 5 are equidistant from Stations 2 and 4. (I marked them 1.5″ from Stations 2 and 4, respectively.)</p>

<p>4. Using your awl, pierce the sewing stations.</p>

<p>5. Thread your needle. Do not tie a knot just yet!</p>

<p>6. To bind: Begin on the inside at Station 3. Pull your needle through Station 3. Pull all but 2″ of the thread to the outside.</p>

<p>13. Go though Station 3 to the inside. Tie a square knot around the long stitch, which crosses over Station 3.</p>
