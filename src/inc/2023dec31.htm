<h3>2023</h3>

<p>Nothing like learning a new thing to start the year. In January 2023 Devine & I finished re-doing all of Pino's wiring (AC and DC), the innerworkings of our boat were known to us, we crimped every termination, fed every wire and connected every terminal ourselves. The re-wiring process had always been scary to me, but now, armed with a new understanding of wiring and electricity, the veil has lifted and gone. A thing is only scary when I haven't begun to look into it, it appears overly complex, but once I start doing the thing I learn about it too, and the fear subsides.</p>

<p>After completing the wiring, Dev & I re-released {Oquonie} for {Uxn}. I re-drew and re-animated all of the sprites, all of the floors and walls. We started Oquonie when we lived in Japan in 2013. This game meant a lot to me, it was a world that I loved returning to. I was sad when we had to pull it from the Apple Appstore. We couldn't keep up with platform updates, and we wanted nothing to do with the hostile toolchains required to keep the game working. The game was then made available for desktop, but it was still depending on services and packages that could break, or disappear. Digital stores and services are volatile by nature, the market <a href="https://gamehistory.org/study-explainer/" target="_blank">has no interest in preserving games</a>, if we want our games to playable for many more years we have to take steps ourselves. Now Oquonie exists fully on Uxn, system updates won't break it, and it can be played on a variety of systems. The platform that it exists on({Uxn}) is thoroughly document, the code depends on itself, it can be deciphered, re-built and re-ported. Oquonie has been cast in amber. Did you know that '87% of classic video games released in the United States are critically endangered?'[<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8161056" target="_blank">Source</a>].</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time making comics for {Hakum}, putting together the bits of story that I sketched out in the summer of 2022. Then in May, I did a whole 360 and changed the concept of the comic, yet again. I had hit a wall, there were things in the story that I could not solve, and making big core changes was the only solution. The 10 sequences that I finished are still valuable, I needed to make those to develop the characters. {Night Terror} is inline with the concept, I also realized that I wanted to spend less time drawing on the computer and so I decided to start shading my hand. The outlines were also drawn on paper, but now I would get to spend even more time away from a screen. I can spend hours shading a drawing, but I don't like spending hours doing digital shading. When I do digital art, I try to try to emulate drawing on paper, I do this by using rough brushes, but it isn't the same. As a kid I used to shade with pencils, I loved doing that. I realized this year that this is what I love most. Kid Rek is always right. Now I have paper, an HB pencil, a 7B pencil, an eraser, and a smudge tool, and it's all I need.</p>

<p>Dev & I did a lot of what we call 'adventuring' this summer, going to places that are not easy to sail to. We had not planned on it, but conditions were right and so we went. We sailed to Princess Louisa Inlet for the first time, tucked deep into mountains, it's the most inland we've been with our boat on this coast. That place has amazing forests, and precipitous cliffs. Our trip there would have been perfect if it hadn't been for all of the mega yatchs running their engines in the inlet during the day. There's never a good time to run an engine in a beautiful and quiet place.</p>

<p>'I wish they'd stop running their engines' has been our mantra this year. This coast is home to many moneyed retirees(Americans and Canadians) who buy giant boats equipped with systems that require the constant use of a generator. Independence from a dock means a dependence on fossil fuels. Sailing in the Salish Sea last summer was more pleasant because borders opened late in the season, we only had Canadian mega yachts to deal with, but this year we saw a constant, and rather sickening, parade of wealth. On land people show status by having the biggest house, or the greenest lawn, on the water it means having the biggest possible motor boat, equipped with the biggest possible outboard motor. These boats occupy a lot of space, and make a whole lot of noise. At one point I dared to imagine us contentedly spending our lives in this part of the country, but our experience this summer has dispelled that dream. These waters must have pleasant back when motor boats were low-profile wooden Monks, motored-boats that go to a maximum of 6 knots. The Salish Sea is now the playground of the aging rich, to whom frugality is a foreign and undesirable concept.</p>

<p>This year didn't start well for me, I had a big fight with a sibling. They live on the east coast(my whole family is there), and me being away since 2012 has only soured our relationship. I went home in September, the last time I was there was in November 2021. I'm happy to say that we had a long conversation and things are now good between us, but me being away is still a problem. To build a good relationship I have to be there more. Me being in Canada doesn't help because this country is big, traveling from BC to home in Quebec is long and costly and we don't like to fly.</p>

<p>Devine & I would like to sail to far away places again, but I find it difficult to do knowing that my family misses me, and wishes that I was around more. I love them to. I <i>want</i> to be there, but I also want to live on my boat. Living on Pino brings out the best in me. I love being subject to wind and tide, I adore being close to sea birds and wildlife. My heart... is in pieces, I feel like I'm constantly being pulled in different directions. Devine & I are thinking of bringing the boat to the east coast, but then it would mean leaving the little floating community we've built here in BC for the past 4 years. I know that I can't be everywhere with everyone all the time, and I guess that means I will always be a bit sad. I don't know what we're going to do yet, it looks like this sadness will continue to weigh on my heart and mind for a little longer...</p>

<p>After coming back from visiting family in September, Devine & I pushed hard to finish corrections on {Wiktopher}. On November 25th we finished the work, and the book was released. Many of the characters and ideas featured in this story date back to 2007, but I started fleshing out the story when anchored in French Polynesia in 2017, back when Dev & I were circumnavigating the Pacific Ocean. I remember being afraid that this was a project that I would never finish, because building worlds takes a long long time and that writing a book casts the rules of that world in stone. It a scary thing to do, but at some point it needs to be done. I hope that I'll get to that point with {Hakum} too someday, the same is true for {mindbird}.</p>

<p>I need to have stories and characters to be happy, I think I'll always have characters on the back burner, waiting to be finessed into a workable story.</p>


<p>To end, I'll say that my favorite book of the year was <b>Le Péril Bleu</b> by Maurice Renard and <b>Roadside Picnic</b> by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. My favorite films watched this year were <b>La Belle Verte</b> and <b>The Boy and the Heron</b>.</p>
