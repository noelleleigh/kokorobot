<p>A useful slip-and-grip friction type hitch, which pulls tight when the load is applied and slides easily for re-placement when there is no load. It doesn't damage the rope it is tied to, and works well for ropes of different diameters.</p>

<p>The loop used to make this knot is terminated by a double fisherman's knot.</p>

<p>Note that the inventor of this knot, commonly referred to as a Prusik knot, was a lieutenant in the Nazi German Wehrmacht (I really had no idea until someone told me). It is unfortunate that this knot bears his last name.</p>

<h2>What do I plan to use this for?</h2>

<p>I was looking for a way to tie another line to a rope anchor rode, so in that in turn I can lead it back to a cockpit winch to haul up the line, this seems like a suitable candidate.</p>

<p>On {Pino} we don't have a windlass, we haul up the anchor by hand, and sometimes when the load is too great we lead a line back to a cockpit winch to spare our backs.</p>

<p>We carry 30m of chain rode, and use a chain hook tied to a short length of nylon rode, then to a longer a line which runs through a block, then onto a winch in the cockpit to haul up the anchor. We have a chain stopper up-front which permits us to lock the chain in place to move the chain hook forward (we can only heave it as far as the block located amidships).</p>

<p>When we have all of the chain out, plus over 30m of rope rode, it can very heavy to haul up by hand, especially in deep waters, and we can't use the chain hook technique to pull on the rope rode. The prusik knot is the rope rode's chain hook equivalent. A line will be tied to it, and led back to a cockpit winch. If the load is still too great, we are considering making a 3-1 or 4-1 tackle.</p>
