<p>A useful friction hitch, used to create a grip point on a rope. This knot can slide over the line while remaining tensioned. It doesn't damage the rope it is tied to, and works well for ropes of different diameters.</p>

<p>Note that the inventor of this knot, commonly referred to as a Prusik knot, was a lieutenant in the Nazi German Wehrmacht (I really had no idea until someone told me). It is unfortunate that this knot bears his last name. A good name alternative is in order. Someone mentioned it being called a "caterpillar knot" in German, but other knots seem to share this name. If you find a good alternative let me know :).</p>
