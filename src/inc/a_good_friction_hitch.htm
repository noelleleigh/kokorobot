<p>A useful slip-and-grip friction type hitch, which pulls tight when the load is applied and slides easily for re-placement when there is no load. It doesn't damage the rope it is tied to, and works well for ropes of different diameters.</p>

<p>In the images below I didn't bother making a good knot to close the loop(I got overly excited about the main knot). If you plan to use this knot with a load, connect the two ends with a double fisherman's knot.</p>

<p>Note that the inventor of this knot, commonly referred to as a Prusik knot, was a lieutenant in the Nazi German Wehrmacht (I really had no idea until someone told me). It is unfortunate that this knot bears his last name. A good name alternative is in order. Someone on Mastodon mentioned it being called a "caterpillar knot" in German, but other knots seem to share this name. If you find a unique identifier, with which I can burn/bury its current name, it would be amazing!</p>

<h2>What do I plan to use this for?</h2>

<p>I was looking for a knot that I could use to haul up an rope anchor rode with a cockpit winch, this seems like a suitable candidate. On {Pino} we don't have a windlass, we haul up the anchor by hand, and sometimes when the load is too great we lead a line back to a cockpit winch to spare our backs.</p>

<p>The hook is tied to a short length of nylon rode, then to a longer a line which runs through a block, then onto a winch in the cockpit. We have a chain stopper up-front which permits us to lock the chain in place to move the chain hook forward (we can only heave it as far as the block amidships). When we have all of the chain our, plus 30m+ of rope rode, it can very heavy to haul up by hand, especially in deep waters, and we can't use the same technique to pull on the rope rode. The prusik knot is the rope rode's chain hook equivalent. A line will be tied to it, and led back to a cockpit winch. If the load is still too great, we are considering making a 3-1 or 4-1 tackle.</p>
